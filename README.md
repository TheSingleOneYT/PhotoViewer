# PhotoViewer
An Open-source Photo Viewer And Simple Editor Intended For Use With Windows Sandbox. Can Be Used On Main Device.

Windows Sandbox does not come with the Photos app or Paint app like normal Windows 10 does. This app is a replacement for those missing apps.

# Use
Import an image, edit it and then save it all within one app.

# Plans
Make the editing tool better. Only allows for rotation at the moment.
